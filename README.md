## Architecture

### Contracts

#### Base Protocol

##### Margin.sol

Contains business logic for margin trading. All external functions for margin trading are in this contract.

##### Proxy.sol

Used to transfer user funds. Users set token allowance for the proxy authorizing it to transfer their funds. Only allows authorized contracts to transfer funds.

##### Vault.sol

Holds all token funds. Is authorized to transfer user funds via the Proxy. Allows authorized contracts to withdraw funds.

#### Second Layer

##### ZeroExExchangeWrapper.sol

Allows positions to be opened or closed using 0x orders. Wraps the 0x Exchange Contract in a standard interface usable by Margin.

##### ERC20Short.sol

Allows short positions to be tokenized as ERC20 tokens. Ownership of a short token grants ownership of a proportional piece of the backing position.

##### ERC20Long.sol

Allows leveraged long positions to be tokenized as ERC20 tokens. Ownership of a leveraged long token grants ownership of a proportional piece of the backing position.

##### ERC721Position.sol

Allows margin positions to be represented as ERC721 tokens.

##### ERC721MarginLoan.sol

Allows loans to be represented as ERC721 tokens.

##### DutchAuctionCloser.sol

Allows margin positions to be automatically close via a dutch auction.

##### SharedLoan.sol

Allows multiple lenders to share in a loan position together.
