     * Function a smart contract must implement to be able to consent to a loan. The loan offering
     * will be generated off-chain and signed by a signer. The Margin contract will verify that
     * the signature for the loan offering was made by signer. If "owner" is a non-zero address,
     * then it will be the lender, otherwise the implementing contract will be the lender.
     *
     * If true is returned, and no errors are thrown by the Margin contract, the loan will have
     * occurred. This means that verifyLoanOffering can also be used to update internal contract
     * state on a loan.
