     * Function a contract must implement in order to let other addresses call closePosition() for the
     * position. This allows margin traders to use more complex logic to control their positions.
     * For example, this can be used to tokenize positions and distribute shares as ERC20 tokens.
     * Such a token would be burned for the closer in the amount called here. This interface also
     * allows for regulatory compliance; it could require the block.timestamp to be at least some
     * time, or the amount to be at least some minimum denomination.
     *
     * NOTE: If returning non-zero, this contract must assume that Margin will either revert the
     * entire transaction or that the specified amount of the position was successfully
     * closed. Returning 0 will indicate an error and cause Margin to throw.
     *
     * @param  closer           Address of the caller of the close function
     * @param  payoutRecipient  Address of the recipient of any quote tokens paid out
     * @param  positionId       Unique ID of the position
     * @param  requestedAmount  Amount of the position being closed
     * @return                  The amount the user is allowed to close for the specified position
