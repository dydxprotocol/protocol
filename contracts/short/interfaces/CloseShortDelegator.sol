     * Function a contract must implement in order to let other addresses call closeShort() for the
     * short position. This allows short sellers to use more complex
     * logic to control their short positions. For example, this can be used to tokenize short
     * positions and distribute shares as ERC20 tokens. Such a token would be burned for the closer
     * in the amount called here. This interface also allows for regulatory compliance; it could
     * require the block.timestamp to be at least some time, or the amount to be at least some
     * minimum denomination.
     *
     * NOTE: If returning non-zero, this contract must assume that ShortSell will either revert the
     * entire transaction or that the specified amount of the short position was successfully
     * closed. Returning 0 will indicate an error and cause ShortSell to throw.
     *
